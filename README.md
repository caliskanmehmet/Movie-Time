# MovieTime

MovieTime is an iOS app for tracking popular movies using TMBD API. The app also shows movie details and has the feature of marking a movie as a favorite. 

**NOTE:** The current API_KEY is inactive. To run the application, replace the API_KEY in the [APIRequest.swift](MovieTime/Models/APIRequest.swift) file. You can get a key from [this](https://developers.themoviedb.org) page.
